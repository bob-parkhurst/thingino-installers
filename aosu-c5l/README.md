# AOSU C5L aka DEKCO DC5L

There are two known versions of this cam, one has a T31L processor and the other has a T23N. Currently we have suport for the T31L version,
and I have one of the T23 models to work on to create support for it next. If you try to buy this cam today (from Amazon) you will almost surely
get the T23 version, so I suggest holding off until that is ready.

# Flash Method

Installing this requires partial disassembly of the camera nd using the magic sd card + flash glitch method in many other model install videos.

A dedicated video is coming soon.
