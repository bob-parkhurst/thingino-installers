# diagnostics

Having issues with your cam but it still plays the chime when you tap the button? This image will automatically gather
a diagnostics log you can analyze yourself or share with the developers! Burn the image with your favorite SD image burner
(I recommend Raspbery Pi Imager), pop the SD into the cam, and in a few seconds you should hear it speaking Italian. That means
it's safe to remove the SD card and pop it into your pc to look at the log!
