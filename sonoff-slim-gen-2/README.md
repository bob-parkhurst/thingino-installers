# SONOFF CAM SLIM Gen2

# This image will upgrade your camera from factory firmware to Thingino. Don't try to use this for upgrading afterwards!

Follow along with my Youtube video to discover and flash this camera! COMING SOON

The images in the installers are updated once a week, you probably want to do a full upgrade after installing!

# THIS PROCESS IS REVERSIBLE

A backup of your factory firmware is taken before we install Thingino, you will need to save it if you wish to go back to factory
in the future. Each camera has a unique firmware, so if you're doing multiple cams make sure to save them all!

# Instructions

Follow along in the youtube video, but these are the steps:
1. Flash the sd card image using Rufus or Raspberry Pi Imager
2. Insert the card and boot the camera
3. Wait about 2 minutes
4. Look for the THING-xxx wifi network and connect to provision!
