# Thingino Installers

**Easy-to-use SD card installers for flashing Thingino firmware on supported IP cameras**

This repository provides pre-built SD card images that make it simple to install [Thingino](https://thingino.com) open-source firmware on various IP camera models. Each installer creates a bootable SD card that will automatically flash your camera and when possible create a backup of the original firmware for easy reversal. Some cameras require disassembly and doing a flash glitch to start the process, which is explained in the documentation for cameras that require it, and demonstrated in the videos.

## üéØ What is This Repository For?

- **End Users**: Download ready-to-use SD card installers for your specific camera model
- **Developers**: Build custom installers using the included build scripts
- **Tinkerers**: Access tools and assets for creating Thingino firmware images

## üìã Before You Start - Important Information

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Read This First

1. **Camera-Specific Instructions**: Each camera model has its own subdirectory with specific installation instructions. **Always follow the README in your camera's folder** - this overrides any general guidance or video instructions.

2. **Backup Creation**: Soe some devices, the installation process automatically creates a backup of your original firmware. **Save this backup file** - it's unique to your specific camera and required for reverting to stock firmware. If the README for your cam doesn't state that the process is reversible, the installer does NOT create a backup and threfore installing Thingino is a one-way street. If you need to be able to revert, you will need to use a flash programmer to make a backup of your firmware before flashing Thingino!

3. **Firmware Updates**: The installers contain firmware images that are updated approximately weekly. After installation, perform a full firmware upgrade through the web interface or SSH to get the latest features and security updates.

4. **Reversible Process**: Installation is fully reversible for some cams, using the backup created during the process. See your camera's specific README for reversal instructions.

### For Developers (Building Custom Installers)

The included `make_installers.sh` script creates all installer images with firmware caching for speed and version pinning.

**Requirements**: Linux host (or Docker for other platforms)

#### Building on Linux
```bash
./make_installers.sh all
```

You can also specity a specific target to build, for example:
```bash
./make_installers.sh wyze_cam_2
```

Running without an argument will display the available targets.
